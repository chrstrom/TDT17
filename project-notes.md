# Initial thoughts

* Try to use multiple countries for training vs only Norway
* Pre-processing: Color, edges, etc (Hough?)
* Ensemble inference?
* Binary classifier for no vs any road damage, then further classify?

# Further steps

1. YOLO (Rohit) and SwinT (Christopher)
2. Do training without anything fancy. Just images in and get the data format correct.
3. Christopher: Preprocessing code
4. Rohit: Ensemble inference / binary classification code
5. Try both models on all self-written code
